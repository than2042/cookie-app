## Reflection

    * The project was part of the bootcamp designed to reinforce React concepts learned during the dedicated React week.
    * One of the challenges I faced involved updating the count when a user clicked the "Buy" button for a specific store. Intially, the cookie count wasn't being updated accordingly; instead, the quantities for all stores were affected. The goal was to ensure that only the count for the selected store was updated.
    * Another challenge was to disable the "Buy" button when the cookie count was insufficient to make a purchase from the store. Initially, the disabling mechanism was not function as intended, allowing users to click the 'Buy' button even when the cookie count was less then 20.
    * I have improved the game UI and adjused the design approach to transform the Cookie Clicker game into a more engaging and visually appealing user interface.

## User Story

🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to click the cookie and increment the counter
🐿️ As a user, I want to see the counter automatically increment using an interval timer
🐿️ As a user, I want to purchase items i can afford in the shop and increase the number of cookies every time the interval passes
